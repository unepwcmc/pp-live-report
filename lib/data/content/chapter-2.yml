blockquote_text: As we enter the new decade, it is clear that biodiversity loss needs to be addressed not only for the sake of species and ecosystems, but also to ensure the survival of human societies.

    "As the pace of biodiversity loss continues largely unabated (IPBES, 2019; CBD, 2020; WWF, 2020), the links between this loss and other global challenges are becoming better understood. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the problems of unsustainable exploitation of nature into the public consciousness (Gibb <span class='italic'>et al.,</span> 2020; UNEP, 2020), awareness was increasing of the connections between biodiversity loss and the climate crisis (WWF, 2020; De Lamo <span class='italic'>et al.,</span> 2020)"

    "Protected and conserved areas (see Box 1: a note on terminology) have long been considered the cornerstones of biodiversity conservation (IPBES, 2019), and have an important role to play in achieving many of the Aichi global biodiversity targets and the Sustainable Development Goals (CBD, 2020). Although data on effectiveness remain incomplete (Chapter 6), protected areas can prevent species extinctions (IPBES, 2019) and experience lower levels of human pressure than external areas (Geldmann <span class='italic'>et al.,</span> 2019)."

    "In 2010, the governments of the world reiterated their commitment to expanding protected and conserved areas by agreeing to conserve 17% of the world’s land and inland water ecosystems, and 10% of its coastal waters and oceans, by 2020. The <span class='italic'>Protected Planet Report 2020</span> brings together the available data at the end of 2020 to provide an authoritative assessment of progress towards this target, known as Aichi Biodiversity Target 11. Furthermore, it provides a baseline for tracking the new set of goals and targets being developed as part of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework."
  -
    "This <span class='italic'>Protected Planet Report</span> is the first in the series to include data on <span class='italic'>other effective area-based conservation measures</span> (OECMs) in addition to protected areas (Box 2). Although Aichi Target 11 refers to ‘systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures’, OECMs were not formally defined until 2018 (CBD, 2018). While protected areas must have conservation as a primary objective, there is no restriction on the management objectives of OECMs, provided those objectives <span class='italic'>result</span> in effective long-term conservation outcomes for biodiversity (IUCN-WCPA, 2019). Both protected areas and OECMs can exist under the governance of governments, indigenous peoples, local communities, private actors or any combination of these. In 2019, the World Database on Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (WD-OECM) was established by UNEP-WCMC to compile and report data on OECMs."
  -
    "The WD-OECM is recently established and currently contains data from only five countries and territories. However, based on the substantial change in coverage seen in countries that have already reported on OECMs – Canada, Algeria and the Philippines have all achieved either 10% marine coverage or 17% terrestrial coverage thanks to OECMs - it is apparent that they will have an extensive influence on future conservation statistics. Their identification and reporting to the WD-OECM at scale is therefore a high priority for understanding both baselines and progress towards future targets relating to protected and conserved areas."
  -
    "The <span class='italic'>Protected Planet Report 2020</span> begins by discussing whether Aichi Target 11’s percentage coverage targets have been met. Beyond the quantitative element of coverage, Aichi Target 11 has six quality elements, requiring the world’s protected area and conserved area network to:":

      - "Cover areas of importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services;" 

      - "Cover a representative sample of species and ecosystems;"  

      - "Be effectively managed;" 

      - "Be equitably managed;"

      - "Be well-connected; and"  

      - "Be integrated into the wider landscape and seascape."  

  - 
    "Each of these quality elements is essential to a successful network of protected and conserved areas, and each has its own section in this report."

    description: "Terrestrial protected and conserved areas contribute directly to this goal. Although there has been a marked increase in protected and conserved area coverage, many areas important for biodiversity are still not adequately protected. The designation of protected areas has played a crucial role in preventing deforestation and is likely to have contributed to the conservation of several vertebrate species. Protected and conserved areas are key to sustaining terrestrial habitats, species, and ecosystem services."

    title: 'A note on terminology'
    text: "Throughout this report, the term ‘protected and conserved areas' is used to collectively describe all sites in terrestrial and aquatic systems that aim to achieve, or are effective in achieving, conservation outcomes. Conserved areas include a wide range of sites that deliver effective conservation outcomes, but where the sites may have been established for other primary purposes. Included in this broad range of conserved areas are those defined by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs). Although 'conserved areas' more broadly are referred to throughout the text, the statistics, maps and figures are derived from data specifically reported for <span class='italic'>OECMs</span>."

    title: 'The road to the Protected Planet Report 2020'
    text: "As the final instalment in a series of reports focused on Aichi Target 11, it is important that this Protected Planet Report is based on the best available data. Over the past three years, significant efforts have been made to update and incorporate those data into this report. <a href='https://www.cbd.int/protected/partnership/about/' title='View the Aichi Target 11 Partnership' target='_blank'>The Aichi Target 11 Partnership</a> was established in 2018 to ensure coordination among partners, and to stimulate support for activities that could contribute to the achievement of Target 11. Notifications were sent in July 2019 and September 2020 to all national CBD focal points, and focal points for the CBD Programme of Work on Protected Areas, requesting updates to the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) and, where possible, the WD-OECM.\n
    These notifications were met with an unprecedented response. Parties to the CBD rallied to provide data, with the result that 89% of WDPA and WD-OECM records were either added or updated between January 2020 and May 2021, when this report was published. This was made possible in large part by the tireless efforts of Sarat Babu Gidda at the CBD Secretariat, and others, in encouraging Parties to update their data.\n
    Nevertheless, more work can be done. As discussed later in this report, protected areas under non-state governance remain under-reported to the WDPA. The potential role and importance of OECMs and other conserved areas also cannot be downplayed. Their extent may be considerable, but it is essential that this is not taken for granted before they have been identified, recognised and appropriately supported. While addressing the lack of data on non-state protected areas and OECMs may be a challenge, it is also an unparalleled opportunity to recognise the role of diverse actors in achieving the CBD’s 2050 Vision for Biodiversity."

    title: Methodology
    text: "Since Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 concluded in 2020, January 2021 has been used as the cut-off for the majority of the statistics in this report. One exception is the coverage statistics (Chapter 3), for which May 2021 was the cut-off. This is because there is often a delay between the designation of a protected area and its inclusion in the WDPA, meaning that most protected areas added to the WDPA in the first five months of 2021 were designated before the conclusion of Aichi Biodiversity Target 11. The use of the May 2021 WDPA and WD-OECM for coverage statistics means that these statistics reflect the most up-to-date information available through <a href='https://www.protectedplanet.net/en' title='Visit Protected Planet' target='_blank'>www.protectedplanet.net</a> at the point of publication. In most cases, statistics were calculated for 1. protected areas only, and 2. protected areas and OECMs combined.\n
    A flattened (dissolved) version of the WDPA and WD-OECM was used in all relevant analyses, meaning that overlapping designations have not been double-counted. For all analyses involving the WDPA and WD-OECM, points are buffered to their reported area and certain records are excluded. Details are <a href='https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/resources/calculating-protected-area-coverage' title='View the details about the flattened version of the WDPA and WD-OECM' target='_blank'>available here</a>. The base map used is a dataset combining Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ; VLIZ, 2014) and terrestrial country boundaries (World Vector Shoreline, 3rd edition, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). A simplified version of this layer has been published at Nature Scientific Data journal (Brooks <span class='italic'>et al.,</span> 2016) and is <a href='https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.6gb90' title='View the simplied version' target='_blank'>available here</a>.  This layer was also used for consistency with previous Protected Planet Reports. Area values were calculated using the equal-area projection Mollweide (world).\n
    All statistics calculated by UNEP-WCMC include additional data not available in the public release of the WDPA and WD-OECM. These data have been provided to UNEP-WCMC on the condition that they are not shared externally, and cover Canada, China, Estonia, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. While India’s data were included in all statistics, the majority of the country’s data have since been restricted.\n
    <span class='bold'>Chapter 3: Coverage</span>\n
    Statistics in this chapter were calculated by UNEP-WCMC using the May 2021 release of the WDPA and May 2021 release of the WD-OECM. For an overview of the methodology please visit this <a href='https://www.protectedplanet.net/en/resources/calculating-protected-area-coverage' title='Visit the calculating protected area coverage page' target='_blank'>Protected Planet web page</a>. For more technical information please visit the <a href='https://github.com/unepwcmc/wdpa-statistics' title='Visit the WDPA Statistics GitHub Repository' target='_blank'>GitHub repository</a>. Please note that the script in this repository is a sister script to the model used for this report but the tools, processes and outputs are the same.\n
    <span class='bold'>Chapter 4: Ecologically representative	</span>\n
    Statistics in this chapter were calculated by UNEP-WCMC using the January 2021 release of the WDPA and January 2021 release of the WD-OECM. Three individual layers were used to depict ecoregions: Terrestrial ecoregions, realms and biomes from Olson et al. (2001), minus Antarctic, Rock and Ice and Lake ecoregions. Marine ecoregions, realms and provinces from Spalding et al. (2007); pelagic provinces from Spalding et al. (2012). These three layers were harmonised and merged to form one definitive layer. These layers were chosen for consistency with previous Protected Planet Reports. Protected Areas were intersected with these ecoregions to provide an accurate depiction of the scale of overlap between ecoregion and each protected area or OECM.\n
    <span class='bold'>Chapter 5: Areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services</span>\n
    Statistics in this chapter have three sources:\n
    <ol><li>Statistics on KBA coverage by number use the January 2021 release of the WDPA and WD-OECM and the KBA 2020 02 release of the WDKBA These statistics represent the number of KBAs that are fully or partially protected per country and are calculated by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC). More information on this indicator and how it is calculated can be found <a href='https://dopa.jrc.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/DOPA%20Factsheet%20B3%20Key%20Biodiversity%20Areas_0.pdf' title='View the information on how the indicator is calculated' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li>
    <li>Statistics on whether individual KBAs are partially, fully or not protected were calculated by UNEP-WCMC using the January 2021 release of the WDPA and WD-OECM and the KBA 2020 02 release of the WDKBA. This is an intersect of the KBA data with the January 2021 WDPA and WD-OECM – the overlapping areas are calculated and compared to the size of the whole KBA. Sites that are <2% covered by KBAs are considered not covered. Sites >98% covered are fully covered and those in between are considered partially covered.</li>
    <li>Statistics on KBA coverage over time or by specific biomes (e.g. freshwater) derive from statistics calculated by BirdLife International, IUCN and UNEP-WCMC for SDG indicators 14.5.1, 15.1.2 and 15.4.1. These data used the November 2020 release of the WDPA and WD-OECM and the KBA 2020 02 release of the WDKBA the methodology can be found <a href='https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-14-05-01.pdf' title='View the WDKBA methodology' target='_blank'>here</a>.</li></ol>
    <span class='bold'>Chapter 6: Effectively managed</span>\n
    Statistics on protected area management effectiveness were calculated by UNEP-WCMC using the January 2021 release of the WDPA and the January 2021 release of the GD-PAME.\n
    The tools and processes used to calculate these statistics are built into the models and scripts listed under Chapter 3. For more information on how these were calculated please contact protectedareas@unep-wcmc.org\n
