intro: "Compared to 10 years ago, the world’s network of protected and conserved areas covers a more representative sample of ecoregions. Nevertheless, 55.5% of terrestrial ecoregions do not yet have 17% coverage, and 52.6% of marine ecoregions do not yet have 10% coverage. Among the ocean’s pelagic provinces, largely beyond national jurisdiction, only 10.8% meet the 10% coverage target. The percentage of ecoregions entirely outside protected and conserved areas is now low in the terrestrial realm, at 5.1%, but higher in the marine realm at 15.5%."

    "Systems of protected and conserved areas will not deliver global biodiversity outcomes effectively if they do not include sufficient representation of the world’s ecosystems and species, a fact acknowledged through Aichi Target 11’s ‘ecologically representative’ wording. The coverage of ecoregions<sup>1</sup> is generally used to assess this element of Target 11 (Gannon <em>et al.,</em> 2019), and is the metric used in this analysis."

    "Since 2010, the number of the 821 terrestrial ecoregions<sup>2</sup> reaching 17% coverage has increased from 297 to 360 (rising to 365 when OECMs are factored in). The improvement is even more pronounced among the marine realm’s 232 ecoregions, with the number meeting the 10% target more than doubling from 49 to 110 (with no further additions when OECMs are factored in). Furthermore, the combined percentage of marine and terrestrial ecoregions entirely lacking protection (less than 1% coverage by protected areas and OECMs) has decreased from 15.2% to 7.4%. Although the ocean’s 37 pelagic provinces generally have limited protection, the percentage with no protection has dropped steeply from 83.8% in 2010 to 21.6% in 2020."

    text: "<blockquote>Systematic Conservation Planning can guide the location of new protected areas, maximising benefits for people and nature, and has the potential to inform broader spatial planning in the landscape and seascape</blockquote>

    Building on the fields of biogeography and landscape ecology, and integrating social and economic concerns, systematic approaches to conservation planning (Margules and Pressey, 2000) have developed over the last two decades to provide decision support to efficiently meet conservation goals. Systematic Conservation Planning typically uses spatial analysis and selection algorithms to prioritise areas for protection based on representativity of priority species and/or ecosystems, thereby maximising positive outcomes for biodiversity while minimising economic and societal costs. \n

        The approach is based on clearly stated underlying principles and target-setting, promoting transparency and accountability in decision making. Crucially, Systematic Conservation Planning should be used alongside consultations with local people and other stakeholders to identify where and how conservation efforts should be scaled up – either by establishing new protected and conserved areas, or by providing increased support to measures not previously considered part of the formal conservation network. \n

        Since its inception, Systematic Conservation Planning has been embraced by large conservation organisations and governments, providing decision support for the design and improvement of protected area networks worldwide (McIntosh et al., 2017). Examples of success span from the recent declaration of Tun Mustapha Park in Malaysia (Jumin et al., 2018) to the zoning of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia (Fernandes et al., 2005), and plans for the conservation network in South Africa (Knight et al., 2006). 
        
        Beyond protected and conserved areas, Systematic Conservation Planning can inform broader spatial planning, helping to integrate conservation across the landscape and seascape, and potentially contributing to the achievement of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework’s draft Target 1. By helping to provide solutions such as the smarter consideration of OECMs in addition to protected areas, or finding imaginative solutions to account for climate change, Systematic Conservation Planning provides a key tool to achieve a future where humans and nature thrive together."

    text: "<blockquote>Adopting different percentage targets for different countries would conserve far more terrestrial vertebrate species and carbon stocks than setting uniform targets in all countries</blockquote>
    
    Countries are encouraged by CBD to adapt conservation area targets to national conditions (CBD, 2010). However, many countries have previously adopted the same percentage coverage target as the global target under previous conservation frameworks. Given that biodiversity is unevenly distributed across the planet and accounting for a wide variety of national contexts, a more efficient and effective approach to protecting global biodiversity would be for countries to adopt differentiated conservation targets as a contribution to overall global coverage targets. \n

        This approach will be explored in a forthcoming study, for which spatial prioritisations using potential 30% and 50% conservation targets were generated. These spatial prioritizations aimed to maximize the conservation of species diversity and carbon, ensure representativeness among ecoregions, and minimize the total cost of the solution. The findings suggested that adopting different percentage targets for different countries, adding up to a global coverage target (i.e., 30% or 50%), would conserve far more terrestrial vertebrate species and carbon stocks than setting uniform targets in all countries. However, the implied highly varied conservation targets among countries (including nearly 100% of some countries’ land mass) and greater conservation burdens for economically-poorer countries indicate substantial (and in some cases insurmountable) challenges for countries to fully adopt and achieve such differentiated conservation targets. \n

        However, addressing some of these challenges, including through the availability of sufficient resources, would allow for differentiated contributions to be made to the global protected and conserved area targets from nationally-appropriate targets (which might vary depending on how biodiversity, ecosystem services, or other values are prioritised). Approaches to mobilize transformative change (e.g. the Three Global Conditions, Locke <em>et al.,</em> 2019), and mechanisms to ensure fair sharing of the costs of conservation, would be needed to support the achievement of high national protection targets."
